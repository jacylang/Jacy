# Code test

This is a simple framework which parses code samples with special comments 
and checks if errors described where correlate with the output.

The source code of the framework is placed inside `src` directory and all 
samples are inside `resources` separated by sections with directories.
You can nest directories as much as you want to divide tests by sections but 
keep it adequate :Ð—
